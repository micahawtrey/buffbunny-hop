Today, I worked on:

* An API for Deleting an Exercise 
* I coached Andrew through making APIs to create a Workout and Get a Workout

Me and Andrew paired today and I helped explain 
a lot of the fastAPI functionality to him. I walked
him through building an API and making a route for
it. He was fuzzy on some of the content but he 
seems like he's getting it better now.

Today, I improved my ability to read tracebacks. 
Usually, before, the last line of the traceback 
was the easiest place to find the error. Now, we
are starting to see that our errors start halfway
up the traceback. I learned to look through the
traceback and find a file that we worked on, then
use that to diagnose the issue.

Today, I successfully implemented GET and POST functions to facilitate the creation of new workouts. Additionally, I contributed to the development of an API. Working in collaboration with my colleague, Micah, we engaged in pair programming to enhance the project's efficiency and accuracy. The collaborative coding session not only improved the project outcome but also deepened our conceptual understanding through active dialogue and exchange of ideas.
